(Definition)
<p>
	An HTML table is an element comprised of table rows and columns, much like you'd see when working with an application such as Excel. Tables are container elements, and their sole purpose is to house other HTML elements and arrange them in a tabular fashion -- row by row, column by column.	
</p>

<p>
	Tables may seem difficult at first, but after working through this lesson, you'll see that they aren't so horrible. A table element consists of three different HTML tags including the <table> tag, <tr> (table rows), and the <td> (table columns) tags.
